Extracted data (ISIMIP historical observed climate output,, ) from http://portal.sf.utas.edu.au/thredds/catalog/gem/fishmip/ISIMIP3a/InputData/climate/ocean/obsclim/regional/monthly/historical/GFDL-MOM6-COBALT2/catalog.html

HIMI model
15arcmin

## Model domain

### Check model domain area

Need a file that has the area_m2 info.
# Load total carbon data for picoplankton and reformat dataframe

```{r}
df_diat_raw <- read.csv("gfdl-mom6-cobalt2_obsclim_phyc-vint_60arcmin_HIMI_monthly_1961_2010.csv")
